## Created originally in GitLab, during my CS309 class

I edited git history to reassign commits to my personal account. All code committed by my personal account was originally committed by my school account.

If Caleb, Zach, or Nick want me to edit history to reassign the commits to their personal account, let me know!

# Project Description
CyRoam is an app developed to make exploring campus more fun. The map itself is obscured with fog, and the fog clears to show what you have already explored. Pins are on the map, and when you get close enough to actually interact with what the pins are describing, you can check them off in the app for points. Each week, the user with the most points gets shown off in a leaderboard.

Pins contain information about the building or landmark they are placed on. Users can see pins through the fog if they get close enough, and if they get even closer the fog will fully clear, fog of war style. Any user could submit pins for the administration team to look over, and add if the information was relevant and abundant enough they would get added to everyone's app in real time. Pins also contained comment sections for students and faculty to add additional, not fully relevant information.

### My Role
My role in this project was to make the frontend function. I wrote a lot of the code to make the map work, as I worked on the Google Maps API to create the fogs and the pins. I also created the screens that display information, allowing users to navigate to and from the information seamlessly.

### Key Skills
Frontend Development: Building and optimizing user interfaces for web applications.

API Integration: Implementing interactive map features such as custom fog effects and dynamic pins.

Interactive UI Design: Creating seamless and engaging screen transitions for an enhanced user experience.

Animation & Visual Effects: Developing fog-of-war style effects to reveal explored areas.

User Experience (UX) Optimization: Designing intuitive navigation that improves overall usability.

Real-Time Data Handling: Managing dynamic content updates like live pin submissions and leaderboard updates.

Collaborative Development: Working within a team to integrate design, functionality, and feedback into a cohesive product.

### Resources Used
Our team used IntelliJ, MySQL, and most importantly in my case Android Studio to develop and implement the app. I used the Google Maps API heavily, and implementing it alone was a lot of work. Our team used GitLab to maintain our code, which I ported over to GitHub and rewrote history to make the code appear from my account on GitHub.
